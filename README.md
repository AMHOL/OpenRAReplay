## Description
A library and executable that can parse OpenRA replay files and produce "sanitized" versions, without pings, exact timestamps, or other unnecessary information. The long term goal is to produce a full gem project packaging both a library and an executable for reading and writing  to OpenRA replay files. However, the library will never support parsing non-YAML data beyond preserving it as a chunk. Examples of non-YAML data includes unit and building orders.

## Requirements:
A relatively recent version of Ruby.

## Installation:
The gem currently must be built from source, although that should only require Ruby and RubyGems.

```
gem build openrareplay.gemspec
gem install openrareplay*.gem
```

## Use:
Running this command will produce a new file with as much unnecessary and personal information stripped as possible. Future versions will include more configuration options.

```
ruby sanitizer.rb $INPUT_FILE $OUTPUT_FILE
```
